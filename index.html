The topics covered are
    1. Displacement of people
    2. Agriculture and Plantation
    3. Ecologically-Sensitive Area demarcation
    4. Keystone species, forest nurseries & community forests
    5. Land use

    14. Protection of headwater streams and springs
    15. River Diversions
    16. Protecting the river systems
    17. Decision support systems
---

1. On Displacement of people

The draft states that there will be no displacement or dislocation of people. It is very important for the draft to clarify this, as there has been widespread misinformation/disinformation propagated by wealthy and powerful vested interests that people will be displaced.

2. On Agriculture and Plantation

The draft states that 'Practising of agriculture and plantation activity shall not be affected due to provisions contained in the draft notification'. It is very important for the draft to clarify this, as there has been widespread misinformation/disinformation propagated by wealthy and powerful vested interests that people's livelihoods, agriculture and plantation practices would be affected.

3. On Ecologically-Sensitive area demarcation

The Annexures B1 to B5, of the draft has the state wise map of the Ecologically -Sensitive area. These co-ordinates were mapped and efforts were made to align them with village names in Annexure 'C'. There are huge discrepancies.  It is absolutely imperative, that the areas and their names especially village names are properly identified. This area demarcation must be accompanied by a ground survey with both forest and revenue departments.

Additionally, a geo-referenceable map must be put in the draft notification. This enables the citizens to give objections/suggestions of certain level of specificity.  The final notification must entail a geo-referenceable map.

4.  On Keystone species, forest nurseries & community forests
Forest nurseries today are often focused on growing species that serve industrial needs, such as timber, pulp, and commercial plantations. While this approach may offer short-term economic gains, it neglects the long-term health and resilience of forest ecosystems. To truly restore and sustain ecological balance, nurseries must shift their focus towards collecting and cultivating seeds of native species, particularly keystone species.
Keystone species play a vital role in maintaining the structure and functioning of ecosystems. By fostering the growth of keystone species, we enable forests to regenerate naturally. These species support a wide range of wildlife, enrich the soil, stabilize the climate, and create favourable conditions for other plants to thrive. Prioritizing their planting can catalyze ecosystem self-recovery, helping to restore degraded lands, preserve biodiversity, and mitigate the effects of climate change.
This approach can also extend to lands under the control of Biodiversity Management Committees, Joint Forest Management (JFM) lands, and areas designated as Community Forest Resources. In addition, incentive payments, such as "conservation service charges," can be introduced to encourage local communities to participate in conservation efforts.
The draft notification must include a clause that mandates the inclusion of native species, particularly keystone species, for forest replanting efforts. Additionally, it must explicitly prohibit monocultures of species like Acacia and Eucalyptus, which are detrimental to biodiversity and soil health, and fail to support the long-term vitality of ecosystems. This approach will ensure a more sustainable and ecologically sound forest and community land management strategy.

5. On Land use
The draft is completely silent on land use. Proper land use planning is essential to protect the mountains. Therefore, the draft must include a clause requiring the state government to establish a comprehensive land use plan for the Western Ghats Ecologically Sensitive Area (ESA) within a year.
District authorities, municipal bodies, town planners, and panchayats, in consultation with local citizens, should develop this plan. It must designate appropriate zones for future construction and development activities. The land use plan should include specific guidelines for areas prone to landslides, particularly those with slope stability concerns.
The Ministry of Environment and Forests is in possession of Zoning Atlases for Siting of Industries (ZASI). These atlases map current pollution levels and highlight environmentally and socially sensitive areas, helping to identify zones where additional pollution should be restricted and suggests suitable locations for industries based on their pollution impact. ZASI should be a key resource for land use planning. However, it is not currently publicly accessible, and the Ministry must urgently release these documents.

6. On Hydroelectric Projects
Section 3(2) of the draft regulates hydropower projects, but its effectiveness depends on comprehensive baseline studies. The Ministry must urgently commission these studies, even if the draft is not notified.
While flow data for large to medium rivers exists, it is not publicly accessible. For smaller west-flowing rivers—now targeted for exploitation—such data is non-existent and must be measured. The Ministry should collaborate with state governments and the Central Water Commission to make existing granular river flow data publicly available and ensure that smaller rivers are properly monitored/measured. This should happen even if the draft is not notified.
7. On Sand Mining
Section 3(a) of the 6th draft notification proposes a complete ban on sand mining. However, an outright ban is impractical and could lead to an increase in illegal sand mining, which already is out of control.
Sand is a critical material for local construction, including homes, roads, schools, and hospitals. A total ban would create significant challenges for local development and greatly inconvenience local communities. Instead, traditional sand mining methods for local use should be permitted. To ensure sustainable sandmining, the transportation of sand across state, district, or taluk borders should be prohibited.
Currently, sand mining falls under the Karnataka Minor Minerals Concessions Rules, 2021. Under this rule, the government designates sand blocks for extraction. First, it is necessary to identify how many sand blocks have been marked for extraction in eco-sensitive areas, followed by an evaluation of who is extracting the sand and for what purposes. Decisions on regulating or banning sand mining should be made based on such studies. Additionally, managing resources like sand requires demand-side regulation, not just supply-side restrictions.
Illegal Mining is rampant. Just curbing illegal mining itself will improve the ecology of the area.
The GPS coordinates and areas of the identified sandblocks should be publicly disclosed each year to ensure transparency.


8. On Stone Quarrying
Section 3(a) of the draft proposes a complete ban on stone quarrying. While it’s very true that quarries have caused extensive damage to the mountains and destabilized those ecosystems, an outright ban is impractical and could lead to an increase in illegal mining, further exacerbating environmental destruction.
Stone is essential for local construction and road maintenance, and a complete ban on quarrying would create major challenges for local development and significantly inconvenience communities. To address this, a phased plan with clear timelines, based on current data, must be developed. This plan should prioritize gradually phasing out quarries, while allowing only those necessary for local use to continue operating. This approach ensures that the needs of local communities are met.
In the interim, the focus should be on implementing stringent measures to:
    • Prohibit the use of explosives such as guillotine methods and chemicals like ammonium nitrate for rock fragmentation
    • Clamp down on illegal quarries
    • Develop a comprehensive mechanism for monitoring and regulating quarrying activities
    • Explore ways to significantly reduce the demand and consumption of rock in construction and road-building projects
    • Eventually phase out giving permissions keeping only those for local use.
Regardless of whether the draft is notified, the Ministry should direct state governments to conduct studies that map all quarries in the eco-sensitive zone. Illegal quarries must be identified and shut down. Additionally, quarry data, including GPS coordinates and the area of operation, should be made publicly accessible on an annual basis to ensure transparency.

9. On  Mining
Section 3(a) of the draft notification proposes a complete ban on mining, a critical measure that must be enforced. The Western Ghats are rich in deposits of iron ore, bauxite, manganese, and other valuable minerals. However, the primary beneficiaries of these resources are located outside the ecologically sensitive region, while the negative consequences—such as pollution and destabilization of hills—are endured by the local communities living in the Ghats.
The local livelihood impact of banning mining is negligible, making the decision to impose a ban both logical and necessary. Even if the draft is not notified, the Ministry should still move to impose this ban under the Environment Protection Act, 1986, to safeguard the Western Ghats and its inhabitants from further degradation.

10. On Linear Projects (Road, Railways, Transmission lines)
The draft is silent on this.
Roads are major drivers of de-forestation, de-fragmentation of the forest, major disturbance to hydrology wildlife corridors and not to mention, landslides. All road projects must be looked at cumulatively for the negative impacts on the western ghats by an empowered committee before proceeding. A technical team consisting of geologists, structural engineers etc must be formed to give technical guidance for all future slope cuttings for road projects.  Some of roads, railways and transmission line projects are identified to stress the gravity of the problem.
10.1 On Roads
Recent landslide incidences along with past studies have shown that National Highways - Hubli-Ankola, Karwar-Mangalore, Madikeri-Sulya, Mudigere-Belthangady (Charmady ghat), Sagar-Honnavara,  Hassan-Mangalore (Shirady Ghat i.e NH 75) etc are landslide vulnerable areas. Despite, the well-known destruction caused by road and railway construction, little is done to mitigate the negative impacts.
On the contrary, roads are being widened at a greater pace without much attention to slope stability and integrity.  Besides the projects are evading the 	Environmental clearance process, by splitting it into smaller stretches. Road widening projects like Hassan-Mangalore NH-75, Shimoga to Mangaluru NH-169, Belgaum to Panjim NH4A, Tumkur -Tarikere-Shimoga-Honnavar NH 206, Agumbe-Malpe NH 169A (Agumbe Tunnel) are on-going.

10.2 On Railways
Despite landslides occurring along Subramanya-Hassan railway and Konkan railways not much has been done to mitigate landslides. More railway projects are proposed - Mysore-Mangalore, Shimoga-Sringeri, Haveri-Sirsi, Talaguppa-Honnavara , Doubling of Railway track from TinaiGhat -Castle Rock etc.  Hubli- Ankola railway line & Mysore to Talassery Railway line are currently on hold.
10.3  On Transmission lines
A 400 KV High Tension Power Line from Mysore to Kozhikode was completed in 2015 under much protest in Kodagu. Some projects in the pipeline - Goa- Tamnar Power transmission Line and transmission lines for Kaiga nuclear power plant capacity expansion.

11. On Red category Industries (including nuclear)
The Pollution Control Board must annually publish the list of industries (Red, Orange, etc.) located within the Eco-Sensitive Area (ESA), along with their GPS coordinates. This requirement should be explicitly included in the notification.
Pollution Control Boards in India are notorious for their failure to prevent and mitigate pollution. Coupled with the negligence of industries that continue to pollute, this has led to alarming levels of toxicity in our air, water, food, and bodies. Given this situation, it's questionable whether monitoring red-category industries just once a year, as outlined in section 4(4) of the draft, is sufficient. It is recommended that the Pollution Control Board inspect these industries at least once every three months, and the resulting inspection reports should be made publicly available.
Furthermore, the Pollution Control Board has failed to monitor air, water, and soil quality in and around the Kaiga nuclear plant in Uttara Kannada District, leaving no public data on pollution levels. A health survey conducted by the Tata Research Institute in Mumbai a few years ago has also not been made publicly accessible. The overall impact of nuclear pollution on the ecology of the fragile Western Ghats and the people living there remains tightly guarded information, which urgently needs to be brought into the public domain.

12. On Nuclear power plant

The draft notification is completely silent on nuclear energy. In Budget 2024, nuclear energy constituted a significant part of the energy mix for Viksit Bharat. So, there will be pressure to expand existing nuclear facilities and build new ones, especially with the small module reactors. This must be completed banned in the ESA. A clause to that effect must be included in the draft.

13. On Heavy Machinery
Unscientific and indiscriminate use of heavy machinery - earth excavators, bore-well digging machines and power chain saw, on steep slopes are destabilizing the slopes. The buying and use of these machines must be regulated.
14. On Protection of headwater streams and springs
The draft is silent on this.
Headwater streams and springs act as buffers against extreme weather events, such as heavy rainfall and prolonged droughts, which are intensifying due to climate change. Their presence helps to regulate water availability by storing water during the monsoons and slowly releasing it during drier periods, mitigating both floods and water scarcity. Unscientific diversion of the headwater results in irreversible damage to the river basin and ultimately to the availability of river water for all(both human and wildlife) dependent on it.
Currently, the headwater streams are being destroyed in the name of drinking water. Consider the case of the Yettinahole Drinking Water Project.
The Karnataka government's Yettinahole Integrated Drinking Water Project involves the complete diversion of headwater streams from the Netravathi River in Sakleshpur Taluk, an eco-sensitive area of the Western Ghats. As part of the project, the government has been clear-felling trees across the forest, revenue, and private lands to construct eight dams, along with corresponding pump houses, massive pipelines, and transmission lines. However, because this is classified as a drinking water project, it has been exempted from the environmental clearance (EC) process. This exemption has resulted in the rampant destruction of tree cover, disruption of natural drainage systems, and degradation of the region's ecological integrity, including fragmentation of critical elephant corridors, all of which we have witnessed first-hand.
The diversion of headwater streams of the Netravathi river system has far-reaching consequences. It impacts the ecological flow of the Netravathi River, the aquatic wildlife it supports, and the drinking water needs of terrestrial wildlife, particularly elephants that rely on the corridor. Additionally, this disruption threatens saltwater intrusion in the river's estuary in Mangalore and adversely affects the livelihoods of people dependent on the river for drinking water, fishing, and other cultural and economic activities. Industrial water needs are also at risk. Furthermore, the project, combined with the expansion of National Highway 75 (Hassan-Mangalore) through the Shiradi Ghat, has led to landslides and structural damage to homes in nearby communities.
If this project were subject to the environmental clearance process, mitigation plans could have been developed, and the public would have had the opportunity to participate in consultations. It is essential that large-scale drinking water projects in the Western Ghats' hilly terrain be brought under the EIA (Environmental Impact Assessment) 2006 purview.
Moreover, clear guidance on drinking water projects is crucial. The Yettinahole Drinking water project is designed to fill 527 Minor Irrigation tanks across five districts.  How can the filling of irrigation tanks be considered as drinking water project?
With east-flowing rivers like the Cauvery and Krishna already over-exploited and embroiled in disputes between riparian states, the government is now targeting west-flowing rivers like the Netravathi, which do not face interstate water-sharing conflicts. The government's unscientific belief is that the water from these west-flowing rivers is "wasted" by flowing into the ocean. This view overlooks critical factors such as saltwater intrusion at the coast, the aquatic ecosystems these rivers support, and the livelihoods sustained by rich estuaries and existing water users.
Bringing such massive river diversion projects under the EIA 2006 is more urgent than ever. Failing to do so would be an act of gross negligence and would lead to irreversible damage to the river systems  (including the springs, headwaters etc) of the Western Ghats.

In the context of climate change, the government's approach to water management must shift from inefficient supply-side solutions to effective demand-side regulation. Instead of focusing solely on increasing water supply, policies should prioritize demand management—regulating and promoting sustainable water use, reducing waste, and encouraging conservation. By implementing stringent guidelines for water usage, incentivizing water-efficient technologies, and enforcing accountability, the government can ensure long-term water security and build resilience against climate variability.


15. On River Diversions
The draft is silent on this.
With east-flowing rivers like the Cauvery and Krishna already over-exploited and locked in disputes between riparian states, the government has shifted its focus to west-flowing rivers. Examples include the Netravathi diversion (Yettinahole project) to meet the drinking water needs of five South Karnataka districts, the Kali diversion for five North Karnataka districts, the Sharavathi diversion to supply Bengaluru, and the Mahadayi river diversion to bring water to the Malaprabha river.

However, there is a glaring lack of data on how much water is actually available for diversion from these west-flowing rivers, after accounting for the needs of existing users, both human and wildlife. Without this critical assessment, these diversion projects should not proceed. The actual flow of the rivers, the water usage by existing users, the ecological flow needs, and the remaining water available for use must be scientifically evaluated by an independent body and made publicly accessible.

Furthermore, all west-flowing river diversion projects must be brought under the purview of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) 2006 regulations to ensure proper scrutiny and sustainability.

Re-iterating: In the context of climate change, the government's approach to water management must shift from inefficient supply-side solutions to effective demand-side regulation. Instead of focusing solely on increasing water supply, policies should prioritize demand management—regulating and promoting sustainable water use, reducing waste, and encouraging conservation. By implementing stringent guidelines for water usage, incentivizing water-efficient technologies, and enforcing accountability, the government can ensure long-term water security and build resilience against climate variability.


16. On protecting the river systems
The draft is silent on this.
The Western Ghats serve as Karnataka's vital water tower, supporting the state's economy, especially Bengaluru, through the rivers that originate from these mountains, such as the Cauvery and Netravathi. Despite this crucial link between the economy and these river systems, the current notification remains silent on protecting the rivers of the Western Ghats.
The fundamental question of who is the custodian of these rivers remains unanswered. The notification must address this by including provisions to safeguard the integrity of these river systems.



17. On Decision support systems

Section 4(2) of the draft, provides for decision support and monitoring centre  to be established by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. There is an urgent & critical need for the establishment of such a centre. Such a centre must scientifically assess and release  a 'State of western ghats ' report on a regular basis. This could provide governments  with scientific data and information, that can be used to  think and develop innovative policies for the protection of western ghats, besides enabling the implementation of the provisions of this draft notification. This national level institution must be autonomous. This must be setup, at the soonest, bringing the best scientific and policy minds together, even if the draft does not get notified.
